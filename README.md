# GST & BAS Summary 2024

## GST Basics
- **GST (Goods and Services Tax)**: A broad-based tax of 10% on most goods and services sold or consumed in Australia.
- **Businesses Required to Register**:
  - Annual turnover of $75,000 or more (for non-profits: $150,000 or more).
  - Taxi or ride-sourcing services, regardless of turnover.
  - Businesses claiming fuel tax credits.
  
## How GST Works
- Businesses charge GST on sales and claim GST credits for the GST paid on their business purchases.
- **Example**: A timber merchant sells to a furniture maker, who sells to a retailer, and ultimately the consumer bears the GST cost, with each party in the chain remitting the GST on sales to the ATO.

## Claiming GST Credits
- Businesses can claim GST credits for purchases used in their taxable sales.
- **Example**: If you sell printing services and your expenses include GST, you can offset the GST paid on purchases from the GST collected on sales.

## Registration for GST
- Must register if annual turnover exceeds the threshold or if required by other criteria (e.g., ride-sourcing).
- One registration per entity is required, even if operating multiple businesses.

## Sales and GST Categories
- **Taxable Sales**: GST is included, and GST credits can be claimed on related purchases.
- **GST-free Sales**: No GST is charged, but GST credits can still be claimed on purchases used to make these sales (e.g., basic food, education, medical services).
- **Input-Taxed Sales**: No GST is charged, and GST credits cannot be claimed for related purchases (e.g., financial supplies, residential rent).

## Invoices and Receipts
- **Tax Invoices**: Required for purchases over $82.50 to claim GST credits.
- **Electronic Invoices**: Allowed, provided they meet the standard invoice requirements.

## Reporting GST on BAS
- **Business Activity Statements (BAS)** are used to report GST amounts:
  - **Full Reporting Method**: For businesses with turnover of $10 million or more.
  - **Simpler BAS Reporting**: For businesses with turnover less than $10 million.
  - **GST Instalments Method**: Available for businesses with lower turnover, where quarterly instalments are paid, and GST is reported annually.

## Accounting Methods
- **Cash Basis**: GST is accounted for when payments are received or made.
- **Non-Cash (Accrual) Basis**: GST is accounted for when invoices are issued or received, regardless of payment timing.
- Simplified methods are available for food retailers and small businesses.

## Claiming Adjustments
- Adjustments may be needed for price changes, cancellations, or changes in use for private purposes.
- **Adjustment Notes**: Required for any increase in price.

## Lodgment and Payment
- Businesses must lodge BAS either quarterly or annually, and payments can be made electronically or via traditional methods (e.g., post office, cheque).
- **Lodgment Deadlines**:
  - September quarter: 28 October
  - December quarter: 28 February
  - March quarter: 28 April
  - June quarter: 28 July

## Special Rules for Certain Sales
- **Financial Supplies**: Lending, borrowing, and selling financial products are input-taxed. Some exceptions allow for claiming partial GST credits.
- **Residential Property Rentals**: Input-taxed, meaning GST credits can't be claimed on expenses related to residential rent.

# Simpler BAS Workbook (Summary)

## Introduction to Simpler BAS
- **Simpler BAS**: From 1 July 2017, small businesses with a GST turnover of less than $10 million report less GST information.
- Required to report only:
  - G1 Total sales
  - 1A GST on sales
  - 1B GST on purchases
- No need to report:
  - G2 Export sales
  - G3 GST-free sales
  - G10 Capital purchases
  - G11 Non-capital purchases

## Eligibility for Simpler BAS
- Automatically applied for businesses with a GST turnover of less than $10 million.
- GST reporting cycle (monthly, quarterly, or annual) is not affected.
- No effect on reporting of other taxes (e.g., PAYG income tax instalments, PAYG withheld).

## GST Reporting Methods
- **Simpler BAS Reporting**: For businesses with a turnover under $10 million.
- **Full Reporting**: For businesses with a turnover of $10 million or more, reporting on a broader range of items including export and capital purchases.

## GST Reporting and Payment Methods
- Simpler BAS simplifies the lodgment process but still requires businesses to maintain records such as tax invoices.
- Businesses that qualify for **GST instalments** can pay quarterly and report annually.

## Changes in GST Turnover
- If GST turnover exceeds $10 million, businesses must switch to full reporting from the start of the next financial year.
- If turnover falls below $10 million, businesses may move to Simpler BAS from the next tax period.

## GST Bookkeeping Guide
- Businesses must report taxable sales at G1, GST on sales at 1A, and GST on purchases at 1B.
- GST-free, input-taxed sales, and non-GST reportable purchases do not need to be included in the BAS.
- Accurate bookkeeping practices are encouraged to track taxable and non-taxable transactions correctly.

## Special Reporting Rules
- Businesses using **accounting software** should ensure it supports Simpler BAS.
- Simplified reporting applies to GST instalment payers and newly registered small businesses.

## Common GST Mistakes to Avoid
- Misreporting mixed purchases that include both taxable and GST-free components.
- Forgetting to adjust for private use of business assets or services.

## Lodgment Deadlines
- Simpler BAS does not change the GST lodgment deadlines, which remain:
  - Quarterly for small businesses, or
  - Annually for businesses using the instalment method.
